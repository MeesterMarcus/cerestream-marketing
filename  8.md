Each slide showcases how CereStream helps businesses transcend borders, making their content universally accessible and impactful.

#### Slide 1 - **Headline: Is Your Content Missing Out on the World?**
*   **Visual Idea:** A globe or a map with certain regions highlighted as "unreachable" due to language barriers, or a frustrated speaker looking at a diverse but non-understanding audience.
*   **Text:** Your incredible videos deserve a global stage. But if they only speak one language, you're missing out on millions of potential customers and vast new markets.

#### Slide 2 - **Headline: Break Language Barriers with AI Automation!**
*   **Visual Idea:** A video play button transforming into multiple language speech bubbles or flags, connected by an AI brain icon. Show seamless transformation.
*   **Text:** Introducing the future of global content: AI-powered video dubbing and subtitling. Our intelligent automation makes your videos understandable, no matter the language.

#### Slide 3 - **Headline: Instantly Reach & Engage New Global Audiences**

#### Slide 5 - **Headline: Deepen Connections, Drive Global Conversions**
